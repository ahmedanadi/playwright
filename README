Simple Playwright test project — quick start

Prerequisites
- Node.js 20/22/24 installed
- Frontend (web) and API backend running locally. By default the project expects:
	- Web UI: BASE_URL (see `env-config.yaml`, default: http://localhost:4200)
	- API: API_BASE_URL (see `env-config.yaml`, default: http://127.0.0.1:8000)

Install
```sh
npm install
# (optional) install browsers used by Playwright
npx playwright install
```

Useful npm scripts
- `npm test` — run Playwright tests (headless)
- `npm run test:headed` — run tests in headed mode (useful for debugging)
- `npm run test:report` — open Playwright HTML report after a run

Run examples
- Run all tests:
```sh
npm test
```
- Run a single test file:
```sh
npx playwright test tests/articleComments.spec.ts
```
- Run a single test by title:
```sh
npx playwright test -g "user can add a comment to an article"
```

Configuration & fixtures
- Environment values are in `env-config.yaml`; `playwright.config.ts` loads them and exposes `process.env` to tests.
- Tests use `tests/api/apiHelpers.ts` to create users/articles via the API for fast setup.
- The `tests/fixtures/test-fixtures.ts` provides a `creds` fixture (creates a unique user) and an `authTest` fixture that injects an auth token into `localStorage` so most tests don't need to perform UI login.

Notes & tips
- Ensure the API is reachable at `API_BASE_URL` before running tests. If your API runs on a different host/port, update `env-config.yaml`.
- If tests are flaky around deletes or eventual consistency, try `npm run test:headed` and inspect the report in `playwright-report/`.
- Optionally, we can add a `token` fixture that returns the auth token directly (saves extra login calls). Tell me if you want that.

That's it — if you want, I can add a small 'Getting started' section with environment examples or add CI scripts.
